# SQL to YAML Fixtures Conversion - Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted SQL INSERT statements from `sqlToFixtures.sql` into YAML fixtures format for use with the Regex and RegexField entities.

## What was accomplished:
1. ✅ Analyzed the SQL structure containing regex validation rules
2. ✅ Created a robust PHP parser to extract data from SQL INSERT statements
3. ✅ Generated structured YAML fixtures organized by language
4. ✅ Validated the conversion accuracy and completeness
5. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation and test scripts

## Files Generated:

### Main Output
- **`fixtures.yaml`** (553 lines) - Complete YAML fixtures file

### Supporting Tools
- **`sql_to_yaml_converter.php`** - Conversion script
- **`validate_yaml.php`** - Validation tool
- **`test_yaml.php`** - YAML parsing test
- **`FIXTURES_README.md`** - Detailed documentation

## Key Statistics:
- **42 Regex entries** (21 French + 21 Dutch)
- **42 RegexField entries** with proper field mappings
- **21 unique validation patterns** per language
- **Perfect 1:1 correspondence** with SQL data

## Language Distribution:
- **French** (lang=1): 21 validation rules
- **Dutch** (lang=3): 21 validation rules

## Validation Rules Converted:
- isName, isCity, isCountry, isAddress
- isEstablishment, isInteger, isPhone, isZipcode  
- isEmail, isKeyword, isLocation, isPseudo
- isCivility, isPassword, isDate, isCard
- isOauthId, isOptin, isMessage, isUuid, isOtherid

## Usage:
The generated YAML can be used with any fixture loading system that supports YAML format. Each regex entry includes all necessary fields (name, pattern, lang, associated_kv, description, timestamps) and each field mapping properly references its parent regex.

## Verification:
All generated data has been validated for:
- ✅ Complete data extraction
- ✅ Proper YAML syntax
- ✅ Correct language assignment
- ✅ Field mapping accuracy
- ✅ Pattern integrity
